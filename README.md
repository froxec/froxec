## Oversteer and understeer detection system for iRacing 

This project implements OS/US detection system for iRacing simulator. The detection model is based on Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)  [[2]](#2), [[3]](#3).
The idea to use ANFIS is based on work of Hirche and Ayalew [[1]](#1).

**Project repository**: [US/OS detection system for iRacing](https://github.com/RacingEngineer/OS-US-Detection-for-iRacing)

#### Data collection
- Data was collected on [Centripetal Circuit](https://www.iracing.com/tracks/centripetal-circuit/).
- Each test consisted of Sine with Dwell maneuver.
- Tests are were performed under different vehicle velocities, sine frequencies, dwell times, maximum steering angles.
- Dataset is balanced for left and right turns.
- Data collection procedure was derived from [[1]](#1).

#### Model
- Model was trained using the ANFIS-PyTorch framework implemented by J. Power [[3]](#3).
- Model for Mazda MX-5 is available.
- Mazda MX-5 model struggles when vehicle runs on kerbs.
